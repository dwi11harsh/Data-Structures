- When we create a C program and run the program, its executable file is stored in the RAM of the computer in an organised manner.

###### _Memory Layout of C Program_
![[Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 2.38.26 PM.png]]

#### Text Segment
=> The compiled file of C program (eg. a.out, .exe, etc) is stored in the Text/Code Segment.

#### Data Section
=> This stores the global and static variables present in the program.

#### Stack
- variables declared inside the function are stored in the stack.
- function calls are also stored inside the stack.
- since the variables have fixed sized and are defined in advance, such a memory allocation is called ==Static Memory Allocation==.

#### Heap
- used for dynamically created data structures.
- The size of the **Heap** and the size of the **stack** are relative, if the stack takes up more space then heap gets lesser space.

## Functions for Dynamic Memory Allocation
1. malloc
2. calloc
3. realloc
4. free
**NOTE:** These function are defined inside `<stdlib.h>`.

### malloc()
- `malloc()` stands for memory allocation.
- reserves a block of memory with the given amount of bytes
- return value is a `void pointer` to the allocated space
- `void pointer` needs to be casted tot he appropriate type as per the requirements
- if space is insufficient, allocation fails and returns a `NULL` pointer.
- All the values at the allocated memory are initialised to the garbage values
```syntax
ptr = (ptr-type*) malloc(size_in_bytes)
```

```c
	int *ptr;
	ptr = (int*) malloc(3*sizeof(int));
```
_here (int*) is being used to type cast the void pointer to an int pointer_

### calloc()
- `calloc()` stands for contiguous memory allocation.
- it reserves `n` block of memory with the given amount of bytes.
- returns a void pointer to the allocated space.
- returns a `NULL` pointer is insufficient space.
- all the values to the allocated memory are initialised with 0.
```syntax
ptr = (ptr-type*) calloc(n, size_in_bytes)
```

### realloc()
- `realloc()` stands for reallocation.
- if the dynamically allocated memory is insufficient, we can change the size of previously allocated memory using `realloc()` function
```syntax
ptr = (pty-type*) realloca(ptr, new_size_in_bytes)
```

### free()
- `free()` is used to free the allocated memory.
- if the dynamically allocated memory is not required anymore, we can free it using free function.
- this will free the memory being used by the program in the heap
```syntax
free(ptr)
```
