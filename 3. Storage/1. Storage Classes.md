```c
int main ()
{
	register int i = 10;
	int *a = &i
	printf("%d", *a);
	
	return 0;
}
```

- Some compilers might give error as the `register int i = 10;` might actually be stored inside a register while others may not give the error as `i` might not be stored inside the register, hence, we are not allowed to write a program in such manner.
- But the following program is correct.
```c
int main()
{
	int i = 10;
	register int *a = &i;
	
	printf("%d",*a);
	
	return 0;
}
```

```c
int main() 
{
	register static int i = 10;
}
```
- here `static` is a storage class and `register` is also a storage class and hence this will give compiler error.
- `static` stores the value of the variable in the data section and is always initialised with `0`.
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int CountFunctionCall(void)
{
	int count=0;
	return ++count;
}

int main()
{
	CountFunctionCall();
	CountFunctionCall();
	CountFunctionCall();
	
	printf("%d times the function was called", CountFunctionCall());
}
```

```output
/tmp/U8FJ3CCxuK.o
1 times the function was called

=== Code Execution Successful ===
```

- Whereas if we use `static` then the variable is not destroyed after the function call as it is not created in the call stack but it is created in the data section of C program.
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int CountFunctionCall(void)
{
	static int count=0;
	return ++count;
}

int main()
{
	CountFunctionCall();
	CountFunctionCall();
	CountFunctionCall();
	
	printf("%d times the function was called", CountFunctionCall());
}
```

```output
/tmp/k4IkbdZMeh.o
4 times the function was called

=== Code Execution Successful ===
```
