_C program to open a file_
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h> // this contains the predefined structure FILE to handle files

int main()
{
	FILE *ptr;
	
	// open a file in `reading` mode
	ptr = fopen( "filename.txt", "r");
	
	if (ptr==NULL)
	{
		printf("The file does not exist, the program will now exit");
		exit(0);
	}
}
```


| Function    | Use                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `fopen()`   | creates a new file of open existing file |
| `fclose()`  | closes a file                            |
| `getc()`    | reads a character from a file            |
| `putc()`    | writes a character to a file             |
| `fscanf()`  | reads a set of data from a file          |
| `fprintf()` | writes a set of data to a file           |
| `getw()`    | reads an integer from a file             |
| `putw()`    | writes an integer to a file              |
| `fseek()`   | set the position to a desired point      |
| `ftell()`   | gives current position in the file       |
| `rewind()`  | set the position to the beginning point  |
- closing the file is necessary as it will free the memory in the heap
- `int fclose(FILE fp)` this will return an integer for the status code, if this is `-1` then there was some error while closing the file otherwise it is non negative.

_C program for file size_
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	FILE *fp;
	int len;
	fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
	
	if (fp==NULL)
	{
		printf("error opening file");
	}
	
	fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
	
	len = ftell(fp);
	
	close(fp);
	
	printf("total size of the text file = %d bytes\n", len);
}
```
