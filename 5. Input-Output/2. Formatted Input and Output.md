### Format for integer input: `%wd`
- : Here 'd' is the conversion specification character for integer value and 'w' is an integer number for maximum field width of input data.
- If the length of the input is more than this maximum field width then the values are not stored correctly
```c
scanf("%2d%3d", &a, &b);
```

```Input
369 4956
```

- **Result**: 36 is stored in `a` an 9 is stored in `b` and the rest of the input is ignored.

### Format of Integer Output: `(%wd)`
- Here `w` is the field width of output data.
- If the length of the variable is less, then `msb` will be left blank and everything will moved to right.
```c
printf("a=%3d, b=%4d",a,b);
```
