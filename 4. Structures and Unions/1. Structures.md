- Structures are used for grouping of elements of different data types.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct {
    int i;
    char ch;
} x, y, z;

int main() {
    x.i = 12;
    x.ch = 'x';
    
    y.i = 14;
    y.ch = 'y';
    
    z.i = 17;
    z.ch = 'z';
    
    printf("x: i = %d, c = %c\n", x.i, x.ch);
    printf("y: i = %d, c = %c\n", y.i, y.ch);
    printf("z: i = %d, c = %c\n", z.i, z.ch);

    return 0;
}
```

```output
/tmp/ttQzzpjDIQ.o
x: i = 12, c = x
y: i = 14, c = y
z: i = 17, c = z

_Following struct is know as a ==template== or a ==blueprint==_
![[Screenshot 2024-10-22 at 3.40.32 PM.png]]

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct ex {
    int i;
    char ch;
};

int main() {
    struct ex x,y,z={ 10, 'x' };
    
    x.i = 10;
    y.ch = 'b';

    return 0;
}
```

## Nested Structures
```c
struct ex {
    int i;
    char ch;
};

struct ex1 {
    struct ex a;
    struct ex b;
};
```


## Misc.

- following syntax is legal
```c
struct node {...};

struct node someFunction(struct node n1, struct node n2);
```
- although this is legal but copying large structures is an expensive operation and hence it is easier to send the pointer to the structure.

_an interesting syntax; try to understand this_
```c
struct node {
	int i;
	int *c;
};

int main ()
{
	struct node a[2], *p;
	int b[2] = {30, 40};
	p = &a;
	a[0].i = 10;
	a[1].i = 20;
	a[0].c=b;
	
	++p->i;  // due to precedence this means (++(p->i))
	
	// each of these lines with space b/w them are to executed one at a time and comment the rest while doing this
	
	x = (++p)->i;
	
	x = (p++)->i
	x = *p->c
	
	x = *p->c // due to precedence, this is (x=(*(p->c)))
	
	x = *p->c++;
}
```
