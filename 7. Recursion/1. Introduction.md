**Instruction Pointer**: also known as IP, isÂ a memory address that indicates the progress of program execution in memory.

```c
A(n)
{
	if (n > 0)
	{
		printf("%d", n-1);
		A(n-1);
	}
}
```

**Size of space required in the stack**:`O(n)`
**Time Required**:$$T(n)=c+T(n-1)=O(n)$$
_Doing the same using tree method_

_here ==depth of the tree== will tell us the amount of space required in the stack_

**Tracing Path**: start from root - travel the leftmost branch first, execute the action and then move to right when there is no more leftmost branch left to travel.

###### Another example using tree method
```c
A(n)
{
	if (n>0)
	{
		pf(n);
		A(n-1);
		pf(n);
	}
}
```

**Time Complexity**:$$T(n)=C+T(n-1)=O(n)$$

**NOTE**:<u>Even though we have 7 function calls in this example the size of stack required for this program is still equal to the depth of the tree</u>
