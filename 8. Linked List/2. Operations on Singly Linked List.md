## Traversing Singly Linked List
```c
struct node {
	int i;
	struct node *link;
}

struct node *t;
t=head;
while(t!=NULL)    // this can also be written as while(t)
{
	printf("%d\n", t->i);
	t=t->link;
}
```

## Insertion in Singly Linked List
```c
struct node {
	int i;
	struct node *next;
}

struct node *new = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node));
```

#### Case (a): at beginning

```c
new->link=head;
head=new;
```

#### Case (b): at the ending
![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.13.03 PM.png]]
```c
struct node *t = head;

while (t->next != NULL)    // we can also write while(t->next)
{
	t = t->next;
}
t->next=new;
new->next=NULL;
```

## (c) after some node
![[Screenshot 2024-10-23 at 12.27.29 PM.png]]

```c
while (t->i != 2) // the value stored in the node after which we wish to add this new node is 2 in this case
{
	t = t -> link;
}
new->link = t->link;
t->link=new;
```
